# Odoo_CentOS_script

Automated bash script for installing Odoo on CentOS.

This script is based on the installation script of Yenthe V.G (https://github.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript)
Inspired by his work I have created similar script for automated Odoo installation on CentOS 7 server. 

Make a new file:
<pre>sudo nano odoo_install_centos.sh</pre>

Place this content in it and then make the file executable:
sudo chmod +x odoo_install_centos.sh

Execute the script to install Odoo:
./odoo_install_centos

Please note: You can also modify the script if you would like with:

nano odoo_install.sh

For example, you can change the version you would like to install, the location of where it will installed, whether you install the enterprise version or not and most important you can change the master admin password you would like to use.
