# Odoo_CentOS_script
Automated bash script for installing Odoo on CentOS

This script is based on the installation script of Yenthe V.G (https://github.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript)
Inspired by his work I have created similar script for automated Odoo installation on CentOS 7 server. 

Make a new file:
sudo nano odoo_install_centos.sh

Place this content in it and then make the file executable:
sudo chmod +x odoo_install_centos.sh

Execute the script to install Odoo:
./odoo_install_centos
